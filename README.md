# Nix Darwin Kickstarter - Minimal

A minimal configuration that only contains the necessary configuration to start using nix-darwin, and can be safely deployed to your own system.

## How to Start

1. Install Nix package manager via [Nix Official](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-macos) or [The Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
   1. I would recommend using the Determinate Nix Installer, because it is more user-friendly and can be easily uninstalled.
2. Read all the files in this `minimal` folder, and understand what they do.
   1. If you have trouble understanding, [ryan4yin/nixos-and-flakes-book](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-and-flakes-book) is a good resource to learn nix and flakes.
3. Install Homebrew, see <https://brew.sh/>
   1. Homebrew is required to install most of the GUI apps, App Store's apps, and some CLI apps that are not available in nix's package repository `nixpkgs`.
4. Search `TODO` in this `minimal` folder, and complete all the TODOs.
5. Run the following command in the root of your nix configuration to start your nix-darwin journey(please change `hostname` to your hostname):
   ```bash
	nix build .#darwinConfigurations.hostname.system \
		--extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'

	./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname
   ```

To simplify the command, adding the following content by create a `Makefile` in the root of your nix configuration:

```makefile
# please change 'hostname' to your hostname
deploy:
	nix build .#darwinConfigurations.hostname.system \
	   --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'

	./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname
```

Then you can run `make deploy` in the root of your nix configuration to deploy your configuration.

## Configuration Structure

Your current nix-darwin configuration's structure should be as follows:

```bash
› tree
.
├── flake.lock  # a lock file generated by nix, you can ignore it for now
├── flake.nix   # the entry point of your nix configuration, you need to add your hostname here
├── modules     # a folder contains all your nix-darwin configuration files
│   ├── apps.nix        # contains all your homebrew & nix apps(both GUI & CLI)
│   ├── host-users.nix  # defines your hostname & all your system users
│   ├── nix-core.nix    # nix's core configuration, you can ignore it for now
│   └── system.nix      # defines your macOS's system configuration(like dock, trackpad, keyboard, finder, loginwindow, etc.)
└── README.md
```


## Notes on Network Proxy

If you are in a network environment that requires proxy(such as China), you may need to set up proxy for nix and homebrew.

Please refer to the `rich-demo` folder for more details:
